## 1. Introduction

Welcome to ToLuist's Developer Guide.

By going through this document, you will learn how to set up the project, understand the architecture of the 
application, as well as know how to troubleshoot some common development issues.

We have organized the guide in a top-down manner so that, as a new developer, you can look at the big picture of the project
 before zooming in on specific components.

## 2. Setting up

### 2.1. Prerequisites

Here are some tasks you should complete before diving into the project.

1. Install **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. Download and install **Eclipse** Integrated Development Environment on your computer.
3. Install **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse. 
(Proceed from step 2 
onwards on [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. Visit Eclipse Marketplace in Eclipse, search for **Buildship Gradle 
Integration** plugin and install it.
5. Also from Eclipse Marketplace, install **Checkstyle Plug-in** plugin.


### 2.2. Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above).
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish.
      This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

### 2.3. Configuring Checkstyle

1. Click `Project` -> `Properties` -> `Checkstyle` -> `Local Check Configurations` -> `New...`.
2. Choose `External Configuration File` under `Type`.
3. Enter an arbitrary configuration name. E.g. toluist
4. Import checkstyle configuration file found at `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`.
5. Click OK once, go to the `Main` tab, use the newly imported check configuration.
6. Tick and select `files from packages`, click `Change...`, and select the `resources` package.
7. Click OK twice. Rebuild project if prompted.

> You should click on the `files from packages` text after ticking in order to enable the `Change...` button.

### 2.4. Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**

* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.

**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**

* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

### 3.8. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.toluist.commons` package.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Logging

We are using the `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* You can control the logging level by using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#42-configuration)).
* You can obtain the `Logger` for a class by using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level.
* Currently, log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : A critical problem is detected, which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Caution is advised.
* `INFO` : Information showing noteworthy actions by ToLuist.
* `FINE` : Details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging.

### 4.2. Configuration

You can control certain properties of the application (e.g logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`).

## 5. Testing

You can find the tests in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`.
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:

* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.toluist.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.toluist.storage.JsonStorageTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.toluist.controller.AddControllerTest`

#### Headless GUI Testing
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in _headless_ mode.
 In headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## 6. Dev Ops

### 6.1. Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### 6.2. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) and [UsingAppVeyor.md](UsingAppVeyor.md) for more details.

### 6.3. Publishing Documentation

See [UsingGithubPages.md](UsingGithubPages.md) to learn how to use GitHub Pages to publish documentation to the
project site.

### 6.4. Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### 6.5. Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, ToLuist depends on the
[Jackson library](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for JSON parsing. Managing these dependencies
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size).<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers).<br>

ToLuist is designed with you in mind, ensuring that you are able to focus on what is important to you.

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
## 3. Features

ToLuist is geared towards users who like to type.<br>
All the features of the application can be accessed through the use of a keyboard, by entering commands into the on-screen text field.<br>

> **Command Format**
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `[SQUARE_BRACKETS]` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * Parameters can be in any order.
> * Options with `/` allow either word to be used. (E.g. high/low for task priority)

### 3.1. Viewing help: `help`

If you are a new user of ToLuist, you may need assistance for inputting commands.<br>
`help` shows you all the commands which are available in the system.<br>
Format: `help [COMMAND]`


> * The system will also prompt you to enter `help` if you enter an incorrect command.
> * If `help` is entered, followed by a command word, detailed help for that command will be shown instead.

Examples:

* `help` <br>
  Shows general help information.
* `help add` <br>
  Shows detailed help information for `add` command.
  
### 3.2. Getting keyword suggestions smartly

You might find it hard to remember all the commands and their format.<br>
ToLuist will automatically suggest to you how you can complete your command.<br>
As you type, a list of suggestions (up to 10) will appear.
  
For example, ToLuist suggest to you the command words `add` and `alias` when you type `a`.

   <img src="images/smart-command-word.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 3.2a**: `add` and `alias` are suggested as `a` is typed.

ToLuist also shows you the parameters available for a command type.

   <img src="images/smart-command-parameter.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 3.2b**: Parameters are suggested as ToLuist is aware that you are adding a task.

ToLuist will also show you suggestions for parameters with specific options.

   <img src="images/smart-command-different-options.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 3.2c**: `high` and `low` are suggested as options for task priority.

If only one suggestion is shown, you can press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to automatically replace the last word of your 
command with the suggestion. If there are multiple suggestions available, you can press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to 
cycle through the list of suggestions, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select one of them.
 
   <img src="images/smart-command-multiple-suggestions.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 3.2d**: Suggestions can be cycled through. The currently selected suggestion will be highlighted.
  

### 3.3. Switching to a different tab: `switch`

When using ToLuist, you may want to switch between different tabs to zoom in on the tasks most important to
 you.<br>
`switch` allows you to view a different subset of the currently displayed tasks.<br>
The different tabs are shown at the top of ToLuist, under the App Title.

   <img src="images/Tabs.png" width="600"><br>
   **Figure 3.3**: Tabs in ToLuist.

Format: `switch TABIDENTIFIER`

> * If a number is given for tab identifier, that will be the number of the tab from the left which is selected.
> * If a letter is given, it will be the underlined letter in the window list name.
> * If a word is given, it will be the word with the underlined letter in the window list name.
> * You can also use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with a number to switch between different tabs.

Example:
* `switch 2` <br>
  Switches the displayed view to `Today`.
* `switch T` <br>
  Switches the displayed view to `Today`.
* You press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> on the keyboard. <br>
  Switches the displayed view to `All`.

### 3.6. Filtering all tasks for a given keyword: `filter`

As you list of tasks grows, you may find the need to filter your todo list to locate a particularly 
important task.<br>
`filter` allows you to finds tasks whose names or tags contain any of the given keywords.<br>
Format: `filter/list/find [KEYWORDS] [/tag] [/name]`

> * Search will filter the list of tasks displayed in each of the tabs. (When you `switch` tabs, the tasks will still be filtered.)
> * If no keywords are entered, the list of all tasks is displayed. (This can be used to go to the unfiltered view.)
> * The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
> * By default the name and tag is searched.
> * Adding `/tag` will search by only tag.
> * Adding `/name` will search by only name.
> * Partial words will be matched. e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    e.g. `Hans Pa` will match `Hans Bo`
> * Search terms that are used in the current search will pop up as suggestions in subsequent searches.

Examples:

* `find Assignment`<br>
  Lists any task with `Assignment` in their names or tags.
* `find Assignment Project Tutorial`<br>
  Returns any task having `Assignment`, `Project`, or `Tutorial` in their names or tags.
* `find school /tag` <br>
  Returns any task with the word `school` in the tag name.

### 3.7. Sorting all tasks in a given order: `sort`

You may feel the need to sort your tasks in some order, so that the tasks that require your immediate 
attention stand out at the top.<br>
`sort` allows you to re-order the task list according to a category you specify.<br>
Format: `sort CATEGORY(priority/enddate/startdate/description/overdue/default)...`

> * The category entered will be given higher preference for sorting.
> * By default, the sorted order is: overdue -> priority -> enddate -> startdate -> description
> * Using `default` as the category will revert the sorting order to the above mentioned default.
> * Multiple categories can be used. The list will be sorted in order based on which category was entered first.

Examples:

* `sort priority`<br>
  Changes the sorting order to sort by priority first.
* `sort enddate description`<br>
  Changes the sorting order to sort by enddate, then description.
* `sort default`<br>
  Changes the sorting order to the default sort.

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
### 3.10. Adding a tag to a task: `tag`

You may want to group your tasks by categories.<br>
`tag` allows you to add a tag or multiple tags to an existing task. <br>
Format: `tag INDEX TAG...`

Example:
* `tag 1 school` <br>
  Adds the tag `school` to task 1.
* `tag 2 work home` <br>
  Adds the tags `work` and `home` to task 2.

### 3.11. Removing a tag from a task: `untag`

You may decide to remove a category from a task.<br>
`untag` allows you to remove a tag or multiple tags from an existing task. <br>
Format: `untag INDEX TAG...`

Example:
* `untag 1 school` <br>
  Removes the tag `school` from task 1.
* `untag 2 work home` <br>
  Removes the tags `work` and `home` from task 2.

### 3.12. Clearing all entries: `clear`

Occasionally, the stress may get to you, and you want to start from a clean slate.<br>
`clear` allows you to clear all entries from the todo list.<br>
Format: `clear`

```
###### /UserGuide.md
``` md
### 3.15. Viewing previous commands: `history`

You may want to check what you have previously entered.<br>
`history` shows you your previous commands entered in the current session. <br>
Format: `history`

> * Previous commands are listed in order from the earliest command to the latest command.
> * Alternatively, pressing on the <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> arrow keys on the keyboard will iterate through the commands previously entered.

Examples:
* `add Test` <br>
  `history` <br>
  Shows `add Test` in the result display.
* `add Test` <br>
  Press on the <kbd>up</kbd> arrow key. <br>
  Shows `add Test` in the command box.

### 3.16. Adding an alias for any phrase: `alias`

For long commands like `mark complete`, you may want to have a shortcut for it.<br>
`alias` allows you to add an alias for a phrase. <br>
Format: `alias ALIAS PHRASE`

> * Once added, the alias can be used instead of the phrase to perform operations.<br>
In subsequent commands, if the first word is detected to an `ALIAS`, the word will be treated as the associated `PHRASE`.
> * `PHRASE` can be multiple words long.
> * `PHRASE` can be anything, not necessarily a command word.
> * Parameter suggestion is also supported for commands that uses an alias. For example, if `a` is set as 
an `ALIAS` for `add`, the parameters for adding task are also suggested when `a a task` is typed.

Example:
* `alias hs history` <br>
  Adds `hs` as an alias for `history`.
* `alias addTaskNamedTest add Test` <br>
  Adds `addTaskNamedTest` as an alias for `add Test`.<br>
  `addTaskNamedTest` <br>
  Performs the command `add Test` which will add a new task called `Test`.

### 3.17. Removing an alias: `unalias`

You may find an alias no longer suitable, and may want to remove it from ToLuist.<br>
`unalias` allows you to remove an alias for a phrase.<br>
Format: `unalias ALIAS`

Example:
* `alias hs history` <br>
  `unalias hs` <br>
  Removes the alias `hs`.

### 3.18. Viewing aliases: `viewalias`

To remind yourself of the aliases you set in ToLuist, you can use `viewalias`.<br>
`viewalias` shows you all the aliases currently set in the system. <br>
Format: `viewalias`

> * Lists aliases in the format `ALIAS:PHRASE`.

Example:
* `alias hs history` <br>
  `viewalias` <br>
  Shows `hs:history` in the result display.

### 3.19. Saving the data

ToLuist makes sure the data on your computer is always updated, even if you close and re-open 
the application.<br>
ToLuist data is saved in the hard disk automatically.<br>
By default, the data is saved to `data/toluist.json`, relative to the `toluist.jar` executable file.<br>
There is no need to save manually.

### 3.20. Specifying a new storage location to save data to: `save`

Occasionally, you may want to change the save location of the application, such as if you are 
moving it to a Dropbox folder.<br>
`save` changes the location for the storage file used in this system. <br>
Warning: If a file with the requested name already exists, it will be overwritten. <br>
Format: `save NEWFILELOCATION`

> * All data will be moved to `NEWFILELOCATION`.
> * If the file does not exist, the file will be created.
> * The old file will be removed.
> * This feature is similar to the `Save as...` feature in other applications.

Example:
* `save data/savefile.txt` <br>
  Sets the save storage location to `data/savefile.txt`.

### 3.21. Specifying a new storage location to load data from: `load`

Occasionally, you may want to load the data from a different location, such as when you want
 to load the data from a file in Dropbox.<br>
`load` changes the location for the storage file used in this system. <br>
Format: `load NEWFILELOCATION`

> * The new storage location will be updated to `NEWFILELOCATION`.
> * ToLuist will replace the existing data with `NEWFILELOCATION`'s data.
> * The old data in the program will stay in the old save file, and will not be updated with new values.

Example:
* `load data/savefile.txt` <br>
  Sets ToLuist to load from `data/savefile.txt`.
  The status bar will be updated to `Storage Path: data/savefile.txt`.

### 3.22. Exiting the program: `exit`

After you are done organizing your todo list, you may want to close the application.<br>
`exit` allows you to exit the program.<br>
Format: `exit/quit`
